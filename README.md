# **smoke bot**

smoke bot is a fictional B2C vape supply store designed and implemented with Django, Python, HTML, and CSS. It aims to provide an easy-to-use interface where customers can browse all items at once or sort into specified categories. The site offers search functionality and an inbuilt stock system to ensure users cannot buy things that are not currently in stock. Once signed in, users can save an address to their profile for easy and convenient checkout.

This small-scale business idea was born from a pipe dream back when I used to dream of having an online store selling all the latest and greatest vape gear. This dream has since dissipated, but I decided to use this project to learn and practice my skills in Django and Python.
